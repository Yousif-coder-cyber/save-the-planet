    <h1>Save This Planet</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome here everyone, my name is Yousif Al-Salihi. I am an IB learner with a personal project aiming to save this city's climate, species, ecosystem, and the people suffering in unbarred summers. As you participate and cooperate with my project, you will assist your country and its people with honor and dignity and save them. After you have got an understanding of the ecosystems and the biodiversity of Iraq, you are ready to get in more depth and know the plants that are needed to accomplish this project.</p>
    
    <h2>Overview of Iraq's Ecosystem</h2>
    <p>Iraqâ€™s environment is diverse, with arid deserts, fertile river valleys, and mountainous regions. The Tigris and Euphrates rivers create a historically significant agricultural zone known as the Fertile Crescent. However, climate change, deforestation, and poor land management have led to severe ecological challenges.</p>
    
    <h2>Climate Change Effects</h2>
    <p>Climate change is causing extreme temperatures, prolonged droughts, and desertification. The Tigris and Euphrates rivers are shrinking due to upstream damming, reducing water availability for agriculture and daily life. The loss of wetlands threatens biodiversity, while air and water pollution worsen public health.</p>
    
    <h2>Geographical Zones and Environmental Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Desert and Semi-Arid Zones:</strong> Cover large parts of Iraq, experiencing extreme heat, water shortages, and minimal vegetation.</li>
        <li><strong>Fertile Crescent:</strong> Once a thriving agricultural hub, now facing soil degradation and water scarcity.</li>
        <li><strong>Mountainous North:</strong> A biodiversity hotspot, but deforestation and human encroachment threaten native species.</li>
        <li><strong>Marshlands:</strong> Home to rich biodiversity, but drying due to climate change and human activities.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How to Help</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Plant more trees and drought-resistant vegetation to restore ecosystems.</li>
        <li>Reduce water consumption and promote efficient irrigation methods.</li>
        <li>Support wetland restoration and prevent illegal land reclamation.</li>
        <li>Advocate for policies that promote sustainable land and water management.</li>
        <li>Encourage recycling and reduce plastic waste to limit pollution.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Plants to Help Restore Balance</h2>
